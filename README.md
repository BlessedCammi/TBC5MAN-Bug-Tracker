For example: [Warrior] Bladestorm, [Black Temple - Mother Shahraz] Adds deal too much damage, [Warsong Gulch] wrong flag respawn timer.

Every bug has to be described thoroughly. “Quest X doesn’t work” is simply not enough. You have to write what exactly is happening and what should happen.

Every bug should be reported with the following pattern:
